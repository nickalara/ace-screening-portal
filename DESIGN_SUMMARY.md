## Design Concept: "Military-Tech Meets Startup"

### Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:** Modern slate/blue theme
  - Primary: Slate 950-500 (text, backgrounds)
  - Accent: Blue 600-500 (CTAs, links)
  - Semantic: Success, error, warning colors
- **Typography:** Inter font family, clear hierarchy
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, professional, approachable

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Landing Page Hero:** Dark gradient background with minimal text and clear CTA creates immediate impact
2. **3-Column Role Overview:** Highlights "What You'll Do," "Who We're Looking For," and "Why StartGuides"
3. **Single-Column Form:** Reduces cognitive load and improves completion rates
4. **Strategic Question Order:** Starts with strengths, addresses requirements, ends with motivation
5. **Visual Feedback:** Clear success states, error handling, and loading indicators throughout

## Screening Questions Overview

### Question Strategy
Questions designed to assess critical requirements while filtering candidates efficiently:

| # | Focus Area | Type | Purpose |
|---|------------|------|---------|
| Q1 | Technical Learning Ability | Long text | Core skill assessment |
| Q2 | Field Work Comfort | Medium text | Physical requirements filter |
| Q3 | AI Tools Proficiency | Medium text | Cultural alignment (AI-first) |
| Q4 | Communication Style | Medium text | Remote work readiness |
| Q5 | Security Clearance Status | Radio + conditional | Immediate eligibility filter |
| Q6 | Travel Willingness | Radio | Deal-breaker requirement |
| Q7 | Motivation & Mission Alignment | Medium text | Culture fit and genuine interest |

### Question Ordering Logic
1. **Lead with capability** - positive start
2. **Address physical requirements early** - immediate filter
3. **Assess tool proficiency** - core cultural requirement
4. **Explore soft skills** - critical for role success
5. **Handle clearance matter-of-factly** - necessary admin
6. **Confirm travel commitment** - another deal-breaker
7. **End with motivation** - positive, forward-looking close

## Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Single-Column Form?
- **Easier to complete:** Linear progression reduces cognitive load
- **Mobile-friendly:** No layout changes needed for mobile
- **Higher completion rates:** Industry research shows single-column forms perform better

### Why Dark Hero Background?
- **Visual impact:** Creates immediate professional impression
- **Contrast:** White text on dark background is striking
- **Military-tech aesthetic:** Aligns with the field's seriousness without being heavy-handed

### Why These 7 Questions?
- **Efficient filtering:** Each question eliminates unqualified candidates or assesses critical skills
- **Balanced flow:** Mix of open-ended and structured questions maintains engagement
- **Authentic assessment:** Long-form answers reveal communication skills and genuine interest
- **Time-efficient:** 15-20 minutes is optimal (not too quick, not too long)

### Why Conditional Follow-up on Clearance?
- **Progressive disclosure:** Only ask for details when relevant
- **Reduced form length:** Keeps form feeling shorter for most applicants
- **Better data quality:** Clearance holders provide specific details

## Next Steps for Developer

### Before Starting Development
1. Review `front-end-spec.md` in full
2. Review `wireframes.md` for visual guidance
3. Set up Next.js project with Tailwind CSS
4. Configure Tailwind with design tokens from spec

### During Development
1. Build components in isolation first (Storybook optional)
2. Test each component's states (default, hover, focus, error, loading)
3. Test responsive behavior at each breakpoint
4. Run accessibility tests (keyboard navigation, screen reader, contrast)
5. Test form validation edge cases

### Before Launch
1. Test complete application flow end-to-end
2. Verify JSON file creation format
3. Test file upload with various file types/sizes
4. Test on real mobile devices (iOS and Android)
5. Run Lighthouse audit for performance and accessibility
6. Test with screen reader (VoiceOver or NVDA)

## Design Philosophy Recap

**User-Centric Above All:** Every design decision serves user needs and enhances the application experience.

**Simplicity Through Iteration:** The design starts simple and can be refined based on actual user feedback after launch.

**Delight in the Details:** Thoughtful micro-interactions (hover states, animations, success feedback) create a memorable experience.

**Accessibility First:** The design is inclusive and works for all users, regardless of ability or device.

**Performance-Conscious:** Design choices balance visual appeal with technical performance (minimal animations, optimized assets).
