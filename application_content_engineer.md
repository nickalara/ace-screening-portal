Application Content Engineer

StartGuides is redefining how America’s frontline forces learn to operate and maintain the most advanced military equipment. We have a proven footprint across the military ecosystem, yet we operate with the agility and mindset of a startup. At the same time, we lead with an AI‑first culture, driving transformation in how knowledge is captured, designed, and delivered.  As an Application Content Engineer, you’ll step into a role that blends fieldwork, technology, and creativity working directly with cutting-edge systems and the people who rely on them in high-stakes environments.

This isn’t a back-office documentation job. You’ll climb onto vehicles, power up systems, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with operators and experts to capture knowledge firsthand. Then you’ll transform that complexity into intuitive, AI-powered, step-by-step applications that make the difference between confusion and confidence in the field. &#x20;

You’ll own the process from discovery through delivery, balancing independence with collaboration across multiple projects. If you’re mission-driven, eager to learn fast, and excited to master both advanced equipment and modern digital tools, this is your opportunity to contribute directly to how America’s warfighters train, learn, and perform.

**Responsibilities / Essential Functions**

- Partner with customers, contractors, and system experts to understand complex military equipment and workflows.
- Identify missing or unclear information and ask probing follow-up questions to ensure accurate understanding.
- Translate technical information into clear, visual, step-by-step applications for frontline personnel.
- Use low/no-code platforms, internal AI tools, and workflow automation to build applications directly focusing on eliminating hand-offs and bottlenecks.
- Deliver consistent, high-quality applications that meet customer requirements and company standards, often on aggressive timelines.
- Represent StartGuides professionally on site; operate with independence, maturity, and strong communication skills.
- Manage multiple projects simultaneously, balancing field discovery with rapid application development.
- Collaborate closely with Customer Success & Delivery Managers (account executives) to align deliverables with customer needs.
- Work around military equipment in austere conditions; climb on/off systems and capture detail directly from the field.
- Travel is an essential part of this role, giving you the chance to work directly with the newest military equipment and learn in the field alongside operators and experts. Depending on project needs and location, travel can sometimes reach up to 40%, but it varies and is not constant.

**Required Qualifications**

- Demonstrated ability to learn complex systems quickly and communicate them clearly.
- Strong visual/UX sense—able to design intuitive, step-by-step user experiences.
- StartGuides is an AI-first company: we look for candidates who are open to adopting AI-driven ways of working and willing to learn quickly, and who bring proficiency with low/no-code platforms, AI tools, and digital workflows to deliver projects with speed.
- Excellent communication skills—verbal, written, and visual.
- Independent problem-solver with attention to detail and ability to represent the company on site.
- U.S. work authorization and ability to pass a background check.
- Ability to obtain a U.S. security clearance; active clearance is a plus.

**Preferred Experience**

- Prior military service, especially E-5/E-6 enlisted or junior officer.
- Experience working with military systems, defense contractors, or other complex technical environments.
- Familiarity with UX/UI design practices, Figma, or related tools.
- Hands-on experience with workflow automation (e.g., n8n) and AI-powered content creation.
- Teaching or instructional design experience.

This role is ideal for ambitious, mission-driven professionals who want to work on the front edge of military technology, AI-powered workflows, and application development. You’ll join a team of smart, curious individuals building the future of how America’s warfighters learn, train, and operate.
