# Email Service Implementation

## Overview

Added SendGrid email integration to send confirmation emails to applicants and prepare for n8n workflow integration for AI-powered application analysis.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. SendGrid Integration
- **Package:** `@sendgrid/mail` v8.1.6
- **Configuration:** Environment variables for API key and sender details
- **Email Templates:** Professional HTML and plain-text confirmation emails

### 2. Email Service Module (`lib/email.ts`)

#### Features:
- **Confirmation Emails:** Beautiful HTML emails sent to applicants
- **n8n Webhook Integration:** Placeholder for future AI analysis workflow
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failures that don't block application submission
- **Professional Design:** Branded email templates with StartGuides styling

#### Functions:
```typescript
sendConfirmationEmail(applicationData): Promise<{success, error?}>
sendToN8nWorkflow(applicationData): Promise<{success, error?}>
```

### 3. Email Template Features

**Confirmation Email Includes:**
- Application received confirmation
- Application ID prominently displayed
- Submission date
- Next steps timeline (3-5 business days)
- Professional branding and styling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Plain-text fallback

### 4. API Integration

**File:** `app/api/submit-application/route.ts`

**Flow:**
1. Submit application → Save to database
2. Send confirmation email (async, non-blocking)
3. Send to n8n for AI analysis (async, non-blocking)
4. Return success immediately

**Benefits:**
- Fast user response
- Email failures don't block submissions
-準備 for future AI integration
