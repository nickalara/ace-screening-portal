export const JOB_DESCRIPTION_FULL = `StartGuides is redefining how America's frontline forces learn to operate and maintain the most advanced military equipment. We have a proven footprint across the military ecosystem, yet we operate with the agility and mindset of a startup. At the same time, we lead with an AIâ€‘first culture, driving transformation in how knowledge is captured, designed, and delivered. As an Application Content Engineer, you'll step into a role that blends fieldwork, technology, and creativity working directly with cutting-edge systems and the people who rely on them in high-stakes environments.

This isn't a back-office documentation job. You'll climb onto vehicles, power up systems, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with operators and experts to capture knowledge firsthand. Then you'll transform that complexity into intuitive, AI-powered, step-by-step applications that make the difference between confusion and confidence in the field.

You'll own the process from discovery through delivery, balancing independence with collaboration across multiple projects. If you're mission-driven, eager to learn fast, and excited to master both advanced equipment and modern digital tools, this is your opportunity to contribute directly to how America's warfighters train, learn, and perform.`;
