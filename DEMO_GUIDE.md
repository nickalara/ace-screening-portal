### 1. Landing Page (30 seconds)
> "Here's our landing page. Notice the professional dark gradient hero section that immediately communicates the role's unique blend - Field work, Technology, and AI. The three-column overview gives candidates a clear picture of what they'll do, who we're looking for, and why they should join StartGuides."

**Action**: Scroll through the landing page, point out the three sections.

### 2. Application Form (2 minutes)
> "When a candidate clicks Apply Now, they're taken to our application form. It's designed as a single-column layout for better completion rates and mobile experience."

**Action**: Click "Apply Now"

> "First, we collect standard personal information - name, email, phone, and optionally their LinkedIn profile. All fields have real-time validation."

**Action**: Fill in personal info, demonstrate validation by entering invalid email.

> "Next are our 7 screening questions. These are strategically designed to assess technical learning ability, field work comfort, AI proficiency, communication skills, clearance eligibility, travel willingness, and mission alignment."

**Action**: Fill in 2-3 questions with sample answers.

> "Notice question 5 about security clearance - if they select 'Yes', a follow-up field appears asking for details. This is conditional logic in action."

**Action**: Select "Yes" on question 5, show the follow-up field appearing.

> "Finally, they upload their resume. We support PDF and Word documents up to 5MB. You can drag-and-drop or click to browse."

**Action**: Upload a sample PDF file.

> "Once everything is complete, they submit. The form validates everything, and if there are errors, it automatically scrolls to show them."

**Action**: Click Submit Application.

### 3. Submission & Storage (1 minute)
> "Behind the scenes, the application is doing several things: generating a unique application ID, saving the form data as JSON, and storing the resume file. All of this happens locally using Node.js file system operations."

**Action**: While success page loads, show the data directories:

```bash
ls data/applications/
ls data/resumes/
```

### 4. Success Page (30 seconds)
> "After successful submission, candidates see this confirmation page with their unique application ID. They can copy it for their records. We also set clear expectations about what happens next - review within 5-7 business days."

**Action**: Show the success page, click copy button.

### 5. Viewing Data (1 minute)

**Action**: Open and show the JSON file:

```bash
cat data/applications/ACE-*.json
```

> "And here's the actual resume file, saved with the application ID prefix for easy matching."

**Action**: Show the resume file in Finder or terminal.

### Closing Statement
> "This MVP is production-ready for local deployment. It handles validation, file uploads, error states, and mobile responsiveness. The data is stored in AI-parseable JSON format, and the entire system runs without any external dependencies. When you're ready to scale, you can easily deploy to Vercel and add features like email notifications, an admin dashboard, or database integration."

## Common Demo Questions & Answers

**Q: Can this handle multiple applicants at once?**
A: Yes, the file-based storage with UUID-based filenames prevents collisions. It can handle 100+ applications without issues.

**Q: What happens if someone uploads a huge file?**
A: The form validates file size client-side (5MB limit) and the API also validates server-side, rejecting files that are too large with a clear error message.

**Q: Is this accessible?**
A: Yes, it follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines with semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and proper focus indicators.

**Q: Can you deploy this to production?**
A: Absolutely. Push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, and it deploys automatically. For production scale, you'd add a database, cloud storage for files, and email notifications.

**Q: How do you review applications?**
A: Currently, you read the JSON files directly or use any tool that can parse JSON (including Claude or ChatGPT for AI-powered candidate analysis). A future admin dashboard would provide a UI for this.

**Q: What about security?**
A: The app includes input sanitization, file type/size validation, and uses UUIDs to prevent path traversal attacks. For production, you'd add rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and HTTPS.

**Q: Can applicants edit their submission?**
A: Not in this MVP. That's a Phase 2 feature. Currently, each submission is final.
